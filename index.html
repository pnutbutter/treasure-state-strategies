            Kali was raised on a dryland farm in northcentral Montana. Her rural upbringing 
            cultivated her key values of trust, integrity, and relationships. She holds degrees 
            from Gonzaga University <em>(BS, Political Science / MS, Communications & Organizational 
            Leadership) and University of Montana (Masters of Public Administration, with honors; 
            Certificate in Public Health).</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prior to launching Treasure State Strategies, Kali spent a decade working in government 
            relations for Montana's largest health insurance company. Her public affairs work included 
            building long-lasting relationships on both sides of the aisle and across administrations, 
            developing and executing plans to pass or defeat legislation, writing legislation, direct 
            lobbying, performing grassroots and issue advocacy, coalition building, regulatory 
            relations, tribal relations, and managing a federal political action committee. She worked 
            closely with related health plans in several states on joint initiatives and legislative 
            campaigns and advised on state and federal matters relating to rural health and business 
            issues. Kali also has experience working in housing, community  and workforce development, 
            agriculture and higher education.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kali is a strong proponent of servant leadership and giving back to Montana communities. 
            She has served on advisory boards for Montana HOSA-Future Health Professionals <em>(current 
            chair)</em>, MPA Program at UM School of Law, Awareness Network, Montana Business Assistance 
            Connection, Helena Symphony Board <em>(past president)</em>, Women's Foundation of Montana, and 
            Career Training Institute in Helena <em>(executive board)</em>.  Kali is a member of the Montana 
            Ambassadors <em>(Gubernatorial Appointment)</em>.  Kali has presented guest lectures on lobbying 
            and policy work at Carroll College and the University of Montana, and taught 
            "Lobbying 101" at Montana NEW Leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            When she's not hard at work in Helena, you can find Kali camping, exploring ghost towns, helping out on the family 
            farm, or visiting Montana's many parks and public lands with her husband and son.

Having led several successful businesses and serving when given the opportunity in both elected and appointed public service roles, Jeff served as Montana's 12th Commissioner of Political Practices. Good governance includes approachable leadership, a commitment to core values & beliefs, and the ability to communicate these ideals.
